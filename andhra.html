            Vinukonda, which has no direct water source, is dependent on the Nagarjunasagar Rigth canal,which has been witnessing dwindling water levels. The local municipality has roped in water tankers to deal with the situation. 
            "Farmers in Andhra Pradesh Protest Water Scarcity, Demand Government Intervention" - Farmers in drought-affected regions of Andhra Pradesh have staged protests, highlighting the acute water scarcity and urging the government to implement measures to address the crisis and support agricultural livelihoods. </div></p>

                      <p><div class="content"><h1>Steps taking place to improve the condition </h1>The Andhra Pradesh Government led by Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has effectively managed the water distribution despite deficit rainfall to benefit the farmers in tail-end areas, but few media publications have been throwing mud against the government by spreading false narratives, a release from the Chief Minister's Office said.
                        There are over 1.308 million acres of Ayakattu (land depends on canal irrigation) under the Prakasam Barrage. Water was released on July 7 for Kharif 2023-2024 and Paddy planting has been completed in 991,000 acres, it added."So far 85.81 TMC of water has been supplied to Ayakattu from Prakasam Barrage. Due to the lack of flow in the Krishna River, water is being taken from the Pattiseema lifting scheme and Pulichintala project," the release stated.According to the Water Resources Department, "35.93 TMC water from the Pulichintala project, 29.88 TMC water from the Pattiseema scheme, and the remaining 20 TMC water is supplied from inflows to Krishna River from Munneru, Paleru, Keesara etc. This year due to adverse weather conditions, the Krishna River basin has received low rainfall. As a result, there is not enough water in the Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar reservoirs to release for the Krishna delta region. The Chief Minister has reviewed the situation with the senior officials of the department from time to time and prepared a contingency plan."
                        The statement claimed that the government has made a necessary plan to protect the crops planted by the farmers and accordingly, the water in the Pulichintala project and Pattiseema has been used very carefully in a balanced manner.It said that data from the Water Resources Department reflect that the Pulichintala project had 38 TMC water storage at the beginning of this season.
                        "About 18 TMCs of water were released for the crops of Krishna Delta till Godavari and the farmers were given water for the crops. As the water reserves in Pulichintala were decreasing, the Pattiseema pumps were switched on and water was supplied to the Krishna delta through the Prakasam barrage from July 21," it said.
                        The department noted that it was a far-sighted plan implemented by the government headed by Chief Minister Jagan, so they were able to store 19 TMCs of water in Pulichinthala through the Musi River during the rains in Telangana. "If the water had not been previously harnessed from the Pulichintala project, we would have encountered a flood-like situation due to the inflow of water from the Musi River".</div></p>
