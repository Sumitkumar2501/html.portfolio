    With the temperature rising, an acute water shortage in Darbhanga has gripped rural and urban pockets. The state of things is likely to worsen over May and June.<br>
    The groundwater table has plummeted, and at several places in the district, residents have been using submersible pumps in search of water. A large number of hand pumps,or tube wells, have failed to draw up any water because of the severe depletion of the groundwater level. The government water supply — managed through the state public health engineering department (PHED) and the municipal corporation — is erratic and inadequate.

    The initiative began with generating awareness and mobilising local people from all walks of life to join hands to save the lifeline of the fertile but flood prone region. Over the years, Choudhary led several sit-in protests (dharna), signature campaigns, poster exhibitions during popular festivals like Durga Puja and Chhath, protest marches and organised meetings with students and party leaders with the goal of saving ponds.
    Today, the local community of Darbhanga is aware and motivated and people from different backgrounds, including a retired DRDO scientist, reputed doctors, engineers, university teachers have all joined the initiative to protect water bodies for natural water harvesting and recharging the ground water level.

    People in urban as well as in rural areas of Darbhanga district have joined in peaceful protests against encroachment of water bodies and are working to revive them. “Now, people from villages and towns approach me regularly seeking help and information about how to save water bodies,” Choudhary, now in his late 50s, said.
    
    Ponds, locally known as talab or pokhar, the common water bodies in water-rich Mithilanchal, are fast disappearing because of encroachment for constructing buildings. Even as climate change poses a threat of a water crisis, the importance of these natural sources of water is neglected.
    
    Gajanan Mishra, a retired officer of the Water Resources Department of the government of Bihar, who has researched water bodies, said, with the number of water bodies decreasing day by day and there are no serious efforts by the government to conserve and revive them in the Mithilanchal region. Choudhary has succeeded in creating awareness about it among the people. Thanks to his years of struggle to protect ponds from encroachment in Darbhanga, some ponds were saved and some revived. Among local people he is known as a protector of ponds as he put the issue in public discourse and mobilised people to fight for the conservation of ponds, said Mishra</div></p>
